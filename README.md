# Hide Fields
GLPi plugin to hide fields on simplified interface ticket creation form.

Currently this plugin hides only the ticket category field.

## Installation:
- download the archive file
- copy content of archive into your `glpi/plugins/` folder, beware that the plugin folder must be `hidefields`. So you should have a directory like: `glpi/plugins/hidefields/`.
- go to glpi plugins page to install and enable the newly installed plugin.

There is no configuration to be done, juste enable it and it should be ok.

## GLPi compatibility:
Tested with 0.85, 0.90 and 9.1
